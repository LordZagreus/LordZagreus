## :wave: Hallo, it's Sparrow.

I am the leader of former Team Sparrow, which was absorbed into the Nightingale project. I now head the Nightingale AI/ML and QDK development sectors.

Most of my projects are now private, or moved to the `team-sparrow` org repo (or both). 
If you are on CCS teams Virtue or Thaumiel, you can send an access request via email.
