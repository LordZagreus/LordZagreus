## :wave: Hallo, LordZagreus here

I am the leader of former Team Sparrow, which was absorbed into the Nightingale project. I now head the Nightingale AI/ML and QDK development sectors.

Most of my projects are in the `team-sparrow` organization repository, but the large majority of the contents of the org are now private.
